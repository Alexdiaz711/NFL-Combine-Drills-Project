# NFL-Combine-Draft-Project
A project using NFL Combine data and NFL draft results to analyze the impact of performing well at individual combine drills on NFL Draft position. Specifically, I will determine if top performers in the 40 Yard dash are drafted in the first round more often than top performers in the other drills.
